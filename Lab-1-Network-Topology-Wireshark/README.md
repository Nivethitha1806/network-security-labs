# Lab 1: Secure Network Topology and Wireshark Packet Analysis

This project demonstrates the creation of a secure network topology using Cisco routers and switches in Packet Tracer, and network traffic analysis using Wireshark. The lab was part of the INFO8490 Network Security course.

## üîß Lab Objectives

- Configure a basic network topology using Cisco 2811 router and 2960 switches
- Set up MOTD banners and privileged passwords
- Enforce login access via console and VTY lines
- Capture and analyze packets using Wireshark (ICMP + DHCP)
- Save and document all configurations and observations

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Cisco CLI for router/switch configuration
- IP subnetting and interface setup
- Packet capture and filtering in Wireshark
- Security enforcement using passwords and encryption
